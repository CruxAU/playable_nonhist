 POR_rio_saga.1.desc:0 "Shortly after our announcements of recent claims on the rightful portugese colonial territory in Brazil, some of our top navy staff have come forward to us with a proposal.\n\nThe proposal suggests that we send Portugese sailors to quietly infliltrate the city of Rio de Janeiro and surrounding ports for a soft coup of the local administration, should this plan be successful, it will give us an excellent landing zone for our forces to quietly begin a full-scale invasion without an official declaration of War until later in the process.\n\nThe plan is simple, but extremely risky to many naval staff and sailors should we be discovered, it is also being criticized heavily by the Portugese Armed Forces, meaning a failure could damage our reputation with them.\n\nNow it just comes to the decision to accept such a proposal."

And along with the news of the Portugese government's supposed new claims over Brazillian territory, are beginning to look suspicious to locals.\n\nIn addition to this, just this morning local police have responded to reports of suspicious activity and discovered a cache of unmarked modern rifles, and even three stored and dissasembled modern artillery pieces.\n\nTwo suspects have been brought into custody, how should we treat this?"

Just now, too late, are the local authorities noticing our presence and mounting a defence, we estimate they will need a few days at least to gather their forces.\n\nIt's time to quickly move our more professional men into the area before we are pushed out."

National and local police are now on the hunt, and routing out anyone connected to the plot."

Such an unexpected move appears to be performed by the Portugese Navy, and has been nothing short of a national embarrassment and frightening manoeuvre by a Portugese administration not even a year in office.\n\nWe have to act quickly if we have any chance of fending off what appears to be now a full scale invasion..."
